# README-generator

Week 9 Challenge - Create a command line application to generate a README file populated using user inputs

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a command line application using the inquirer package that would prompt the user for several inputs and then compile those inputs into a professional README.md file. I created this project to further familiarize myself with modularization as well as using additional npm packages that are commonly used. Through this project I have learned easy ways to accept user inputs through the command line and how to take the data from those inputs and dynamically apply it to write additional files. During this project I also realized that my coding and comfortability using various JS tools has gotten much better and much faster.
