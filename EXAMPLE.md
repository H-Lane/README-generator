  ## Installation
  Download the application from Github and make sure to run npm install in your terminal to ensure all dependencies are in place.

  ## Usage
  Open the index.js file in your terminal of choice, that has Nodejs installed, then run node index.js in your terminal. This will give you a series of prompts to answer. Your answers will populate directly onto your README.

  ## Test
  Create a sample README file using the node index.js initialization and ensure that everything populates as expected.

  ## Contribution
  This is a solo project, but any optimization suggestions are welcome.
